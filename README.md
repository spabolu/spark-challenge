### Saketh, Matt, Khushi, Anish


Project consists of a frontend and a backend. The backend runs on AWS technologies and the frontend runs on Next.js with TailwindCSS for styling. Unfortunately, the access to AWS technologies provided by Aditya Challa expired within 3 days of use and the production code doesn't run as expected with the lack of functional backend. However, the code presented in the repository shows the usecase of backend services used AWS S3 Bucket, AWS Textract, AWS Lambda, AWS SageMaker and lastly, AWS RDS.

To run the frontend project, navigate to the frontend directory and simply run `npm run dev`. You need to have node and npm installed on the machine.

Instructions for the AWS Lambda are available [here]([https://www.genome.gov/](https://github.com/spabolu/spark-challenge/blob/main/AWS_Lambda/README.md )).
